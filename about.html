      <h3>Culture</h3>

      The African tradition religion was also destroyed due to the introduction of Christianity, they forced the people to learn their language, taught them how to eat European food and dress like Europeans abandoning their own traditional way of eating habits and dressing and the spread of virulent diseases.

      Africans we can only change these culture by relying on our owns which many countries have tried but still they can't. Development of our country can lead to self dependancy which makes and lead to conflicts, but if we can fit in our own house this can give us chance to change and empower our culture.

   <h4>Conflicts</h4>

    Families were torn apart due to partition of Africa which created new boundaries leading to present conflicts and the slave trade which millions of people away from their families and homelands.
    The colonialists made the currency too difficult for Africans to obtain. The way they did this was to make the prices of raw materials and agricultural products produced by Africans to be too cheap. On the other hand, the colonialists made the prices of goods manufactured by them to be too dear or high, so that an African would spend all he had toiled for, for year or more to purchase a little of the foreign goods. The implication of this was that Africans kept on working hard and making their labour service available to the colonialists in order to enjoy some of the foreign manufactured goods they required.

   <h5>Education</h5>

   Colonialsm introduced the structure of education.This made africans more knowlegeable in that they could go to school,learn become educated.This has led to growth of the economic state of the country and different individuals. New technology which have lead to development in most of the countries in Africa.</p>  
   
    <p>
   <h5>Transport</h5>
   <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRDTer7Ur7VJBXUyNP2pMBLPb-JEw2gvn3JXQ&usqp=CAU" style="width: 100%;height: 100%;">
   
   The colonialists distorted and disarticulated the development of a comprehensive transport system in Africa. The transport network developed was not to link
different towns and rural areas for purpose of effective communication and development. Transport routes were built by the colonialists to enable them to evacuate easily the raw materials from their sources or base to the destination point where they could be effectively exported abroad. The transport network developed was essentially rails and seaports. There was no good effort to develop an organised road network which would help to improve the lives of the African people and their interaction with their relations in the different parts of the territories. The distorted, disjointed, and disarticulated transport system developed by the colonialists did not allow for effective agricultural and economic integration within the different parts of the African enclaves and territories. There was
therefore absence of economic integration and cooperation among the African territories during the period of colonialism </p>

      Beyond my senses, I leave more successful always, and simplifying things makes my dreams alive. In personal life right now I face an unprecedented level of complexity practically every moment of the day, but working harmony in every sense pulls/ load and reloads of information that I am getting every day around me.
      In times this part of our visual memory is constantly beyond what we see and we think this makes life more precious and being more than I am.

    In the classes, we have covered more about how to handle things even when they are tough than usual. In the book Born A Crime, we have seen how the write predicted things before they had happened and visualizing for the dreams he had. Beyond the senses, I have a vision board that I have put down some images, big words which just a vision “dream” of what I wish to have after some year and that will be a move accomplished “I will make it since I am working on it”.

      If one disease can provide wisdom beyond our comprehension of the fragile interconnected and precious life is, the COVID-19 offers a novel of lessons on a personal, regional, and planetary.
      Young youths this is the time to feel that if you have any piece of a word to offer this is the open chance to share with friends and even the society and move life as normal even though is just visualizing around.

      In tech, most youths are using these hard times and days to offer any knowledge they have.
      You young man/lady you are there out without knowing how your tomorrow will start I would ask you to hold once and engage yourself with that small group that praises you and does what you can or offer the chances and services you can. We live in a world full of wonders this the best time to show who you are and what you can offer.
