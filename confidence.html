          Life is all about expetations which we always think to be perfect, nobody is perfect, I spend my time listening to those people with more confidence than me where I learn all the tips to follow and to do so that I can be like them. It is not simple to many when trying to address the group or audience on the stage being that they have low confidence toward their estime. I love what I do daily towards the building over my confidence. One thing I know is that confidence is not made but is build in you. No one is perfect in this life, be you I am me always me.
